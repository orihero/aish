Evaluation Criteria:
1. Requirement Match: Evaluate each specific requirement from the job posting (score 1-10 for each)
2. Skill Match: Assess technical and professional skills alignment (score 1-10 for each skill)
3. Soft Skill Match: Evaluate language proficiency, communication, teamwork, etc. (score 1-10 for each)
4. Organizational Match: Location compatibility (skip if remote position) (score 1-10)

Scoring Guidelines (1-10 scale):
- 9-10: Exceptional match, exceeds requirements
- 7-8: Strong match, meets requirements well
- 5-6: Adequate match, meets basic requirements
- 3-4: Below average, some gaps
- 1-2: Poor match, significant gaps

For each evaluation category:
- Calculate totalScore as average of all items in that category (must be between 1-10)
- Use scoreBase of 10 for all items
- Provide specific, actionable feedback for each item
- Skip Organizational Match if the position is remote
- IMPORTANT: All scores must be on a 1-10 scale. Do not use scores like 38/10 or 85/10.

Do not include any markdown, formatting, or text outside the JSON object.`;
